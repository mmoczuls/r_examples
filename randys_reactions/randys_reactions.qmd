## Homework Assignment 1

Thanks Michelle for your notes and work!  I have a few comments/questions for you:

* what is that mermaid code chuck all about?
* is there a ColorCode.png file somewhere?
* where is the 'nitrogenaverage' data?

OK with those questions, aim to have your code/quarto docs be set up something like:

* load packages 
* load data
* then write any prose and proceed with analysis and dta vis

This will help to organize things and make sure that other people (like me) can run your code.  Also-without the data you get an error!

Also, add an 'images' directory (like this 'dir.create('images') in the console), then put any images there .  Then you will call them like

![Color Code](images/ColorCode.png)
