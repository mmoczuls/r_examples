# Custom colour palettes for ggplot2 notes

### Color packages on R:
* ggplot2
    + Can do it manually with scale_colour_manual()
* RColorBrewer
* viridis

### Building a colour palette

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Define your colours] --> B[Generate a palette from your list of colours]
  B --> C[Create ggplot2 functions to use your palette]
```

### Defining Colors and generating a palette

* Create a named list for your color palette
  - Ex: Color_Purple <- c(rbg values)
* Follow function attached below and include...
  - the name of the colour palette we want to use,
  - the list of colour palettes we want to extract our choice from,
  - how many colours from it we want to use
  - whether we want a discrete or continuous colour palette

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
# Basic scatterplot

plot(x=nitrogenaverage$Month, y=nitrogenaverage$Nitrogen, pch=18, xlab= "Month", ylab = "Nitrogen (mg/L)")

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
