### Mangroves
##### Background
* Mangroves are coastal shrubs with thick roots that serve:
  + Safe nurseries for young fish
  + Stabilizers for coastlines
  + Nutrient filters
  + And much more

* My senior thesis will focus on:
  + Nutrient pollution (nitrogen and phosphorus) in St. John's County, Florida
  + Land use change in St. John's County, Florida:
    - Urbanization
    - Agriculture
    - Mangroves and wetlands
  + If and how land use change and nutrient pollution are interconnected
    
Urbanization
: the shift of human populations from rural to urban areas, as well as the transformation of land for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation purposes 


### Nitrogen and Phosphorus

* Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are sourced from both naturally occurring and anthropogenic vessels
* N and P are rarely found in raw form. Rather, they are found in variations such as...
  + NH4: ammonium
  + NOx: nitric oxide
  + PO4: Phosphate
  + And more, but my thesis will focus on these 3
* An excess amount of N and P leads to eutrophication, which then leads to 
  + Oxygen depletion
  + Species loss
  + Increased turbidity
  + And potentially ecosystem collapse
* N and P are limiting nutrients, thus protecting mangroves will not only reduce nutrient pollution but also improve mangrove growth. Win-win :)

Eutrophication
: a process where an aquatic ecosystem gets an excess of nutrients from an external source, such as urban runoff, and promotes phytoplankton growth

Red Tides
: similar to eutrophication. When there is an excessive amount of algal growth and causes discoloration of the water from toxic red dinoflagellates

Limiting Nutrients
:  nutrient that limits the potential for growth and reproduction in an organism or population. Within an ecosystem, plants, animals and other living organisms require certain nutrients to grow and reproduce

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
